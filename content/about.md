## Hello World :wave:

This blog is mainly for recording and sharing what I learned about software development in general. At this moment, most of drafts are written in Korean, but sometimes I'll force myself to use English just so that I'm not loosing it completely. I used to live in Chitown :cityscape: . I'm based in South Korea :kr: since 2018.

Just so you know, I'm very new to blogging. Depends on my interest and career, the main topic of this blog is subject to change.

## I'm \_ \_ \_ :raising_hand:

- a cloud researcher :cloud:
- working with Kubernetes

## I've been \_ \_ \_ :laptop:

- developing K8s operators, RESTful APIs and web applications
- using Java, Go, Postgres, PHP and Linux
